**Vassar Marketplace Elaboration Phase 3 Update**

All use cases have been identified and explored.  All sequence diagrams were created and updated as well as the design class diagram.  The app was successfully transferred from java code to a working android prototype.  The ability for the seller to navigate the posted items interface has been added, but is still being finalized.  Unit tests have been created to confirm that they are working as they should be. 

_A Message to our Users:_

For now, all items added to the marketplace won't be validated and will come from a default seller since the validation methods haven't been finalized yet.  The Vassar Marketplace developers value a safe and inclusive environment and felt that this was the best decision for the soft launch of Vassar Marketplace.  Don't fret, our Terms of service, including the banned phrases list, is being finalized now to ensure that all users can fully utilize this amazing interface!
