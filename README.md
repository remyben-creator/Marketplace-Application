All use cases have been identified and explored.  All sequence diagrams were created and updated as well as the design class diagram.  The app was successfully transferred from java code to a working android prototype.  The ability for the seller to navigate the posted items interface has been added and all methods are confirmed working based on unit tests created.  Unfortunately, android system tests were not able to be completed.  

All items added to the marketplace will come from a Default seller and the items won't be validated as that functionality is going to be implemented during the next iteration.
