**Brewers Closet**

The developers are excited to announce that after a long yet very rewarding journey, Brewers Closet is ready for launch!  We started by identifying all use cases for the application.  Once all use cases were written, sequence and design class diagrams were created in the doc folder providing users with both a static and dynamic view of the app.  The first prototype of Brewers Closet was created in Java and then transferred over to Android Studio so it can be launched on the Google Play Store! 

We encourage all Vassar students to make an account and start utilizing Brewers Closet.  Once an account has been created, you can act as both a buyer and a seller.  On the sell side, users can post items to the application, manage all posted items at any time, and view the people who have expressed interest in your items.  If an interest message doesn't resonate well with you, you can always delete it!  On the buy side, whenever you load the app you will be shown the 10 most recently posted items by other users.  If you have something specific you are looking for, feel free to use our search feature to see only those items!

_User Safety:_

The developers of Brewers Closet believe that every user should feel comfortable using the application.  For that reason, we have a built in moderator that will prohibit items that violate our Terms Of Service from being posted.  In an effort to maintain the integrity of our target audience, the moderator will also only allow users with a Vassar College email address to create accounts.
