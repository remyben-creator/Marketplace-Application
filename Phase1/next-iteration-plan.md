# Next Iteration Plan

- The first use cases we will need to work on for our prototype model
are the ability to post items from a sellers angle, and to find items to 
buy from a buyers angle.
- These are important because it under a bare-bones 
product, these are the only two required functional abilities.
- These will both be through a default account
(the account making will come hopefully after)
