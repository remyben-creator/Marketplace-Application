# Next Iteration Plan

- The next use case we will need to work on for our prototype model
  is  the ability for sellers to manage their posted items.
  including the change price and remove item subfunctions.
- Since we dealt with the search for items use case in this iteration, 
  now we want to work on the marketplace from the seller's perspective.
- Once the seller can edit their items we can work on the complete sale
  and make account use cases.  

# Requirements Update
- Our group didn't have any major requirement changes, but we did have 
  to update our search-for-items use case which we hadn't analyzed in 
  depth yet.  If there are no similar items on the marketplace, the
  user will see a message depicting that. The use case has been 
  updated to reflect the change.
