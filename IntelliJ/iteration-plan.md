# Next Iteration Plan

- The next iteration will focus almost entirely on transferring our java code to a working android prototype.
- We will also finalize all the use cases so we can continue to develop the application's functionality

# Requirements Update
- Our group didn't have any major requirement changes, but we did have 
  to update our search-for-items use case which we hadn't analyzed in 
  depth yet.  If there are no similar items on the marketplace, the
  user will see a message depicting that. The use case has been 
  updated to reflect the change.  


# Next Iteration Plan
- Our final iteration will be focused on adding the ability for users to create accounts and creating the validating methods to ensure posts adhere to marketplace guidelines


# Requirements Update
- We separated our post class to contain and item and a seller rather than a seller and all the item information
